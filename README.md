1238 Applications of Data Science: Large Language Models https://canvas.wu.ac.at/courses/14554

Our task is to develop an LLM that supports legal experts in identifying relevant laws for specific cases. The idea is straightforward: the user provides a case description, and the model outputs the specific legal articles or paragraphs that may apply. It is important to note that the model will not predict case outcomes or provide legal conclusions. Such tasks would require specialized legal expertise that we do not have and cannot train the model for. Our focus is strictly on information retrieval, not legal interpretation.
